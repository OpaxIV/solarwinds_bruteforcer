# SolarWinds Brueforcer
This repository contains a bruteforcer, than can be used specifically for the malware found during the SolarWinds breach. The bruteforcer was written in Python and already contains the found hashes of the malware.

## Disclaimer
This bruteforcer was made for educational purposes only. I do not condemn the usage of this tool in any illegal operation, nor am I responsible for any damages done to other systems.

## Affiliation
I want to point out, that an independently written project already existed before the publication of this repository. The tool found at https://github.com/mrphrazer/sunburst_hasher was written in Rust by mrphrazer and is quicker in its execution. I highly recommend checking it out.
